## Overview

The SSRF Scanner is a Python-based tool designed to scan for potential SSRF vulnerabilities in web applications and network environments. It includes a variety of modules for input validation, URL parsing, response handling, authentication and authorization, vulnerability detection, and output reporting.

With the SSRF Scanner, security professionals can quickly and easily identify potential SSRF vulnerabilities in their applications and networks, and take appropriate remediation measures to address these vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.

## Installation

To install the SSRF Scanner, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies using pip.
3. Set up any necessary configuration files or credentials.

## Usage

To use the SSRF Scanner, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the SSRF Scanner is installed.
3. Run the ssrf_scanner.py script with the appropriate command line arguments and options.
4. View the output report generated by the tool, which summarizes any detected vulnerabilities and provides recommendations for remediation.

## Working of the Code

The SSRF Scanner is a Python-based tool that scans for potential SSRF vulnerabilities in web applications and network environments. It uses a variety of techniques to detect potential vulnerabilities, including input validation, URL parsing and manipulation, response handling and analysis, authentication and authorization, and vulnerability detection.

Here's a brief overview of how the different modules work together:

The input validation and sanitization module ensures that user-supplied input, such as URLs and network requests, is valid and does not contain any unexpected or malicious values. This helps prevent the scanner from processing invalid or dangerous input.

The URL parsing and manipulation module uses Python libraries such as urllib and urlparse to parse different types of URLs and network requests. It also manipulates the URLs to test for potential SSRF vulnerabilities, such as using IP addresses or local file paths.

The response handling and analysis module uses Python libraries such as Requests or urllib to send requests and handle server responses. It analyzes the HTTP status codes, response headers, and response bodies to detect potential SSRF vulnerabilities. It looks for signs of successful SSRF attacks, such as the ability to access internal resources or execute arbitrary commands.

The authentication and authorization module handles different types of authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as cookies, tokens, and API keys. It uses Python libraries such as requests-oauthlib or pyjwt to handle authentication and authorization for different types of requests and responses. It tests for potential vulnerabilities related to authentication and authorization, such as weak passwords or token leaks.

The vulnerability detection module uses the output of the previous modules to detect SSRF vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for remediation. It analyzes the results of the response handling and analysis module to identify potential SSRF vulnerabilities. It tests for SSRF vulnerabilities in a variety of scenarios, such as cloud environments, internal networks, and public-facing applications.

The output reporting module summarizes the vulnerabilities found and provides recommendations for remediation. It generates detailed reports that provide information about the detected vulnerabilities and their severity. It includes actionable recommendations for remediation, such as patching vulnerabilities or updating security configurations.

By combining these different modules and techniques, the SSRF Scanner is able to quickly and accurately detect potential SSRF vulnerabilities in a wide variety of scenarios and environments.
